      " This SQL query is designed to retrieve information about the most commonly prescribed drugs along with the conditions they are used to treat. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the query does:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SELECT Statement**: The query selects three pieces of information:\n",
      "   - `d.DRUG_CONCEPT_ID`: The identifier for the drug.\n",
      "   - `COUNT(d.DRUG_EXPOSURE_ID) AS drug_count`: The total number of times each drug has been prescribed, counted by the unique drug exposure IDs.\n",
      "   - `co.CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID`: The identifier for the condition that the drug is treating.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **FROM Clause**: The data is being pulled from two tables:\n",
      "   - `DRUG_EXPOSURE` (aliased as `d`), which contains records of drug prescriptions.\n",
      "   - `CONDITION_OCCURRENCE` (aliased as `co`), which contains records of medical conditions diagnosed in patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **JOIN Clause**: The query uses an inner join to connect the two tables based on the `PERSON_ID`, meaning it only considers records where there is a matching patient in both tables. This ensures that the drugs and conditions are related to the same individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **GROUP BY Clause**: The results are grouped by both the drug ID and the condition ID. This means that for each unique combination of drug and condition, the query will count how many times that drug has been prescribed for that condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **ORDER BY Clause**: The results are sorted in descending order based on the `drug_count`, so the most frequently prescribed drugs appear first.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **LIMIT Clause**: Finally, the query limits the results to the top 10 entries, which means it will only show the 10 most prescribed drugs along with their counts and the conditions they are associated with.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this query effectively answers the user's question by providing a list of the 10 drugs that have been prescribed the most, along with how many times each drug was prescribed and the specific conditions they were used to treat.\n",
