Waiting to get access to UCSF's Versa API

Got access to the private UCSF git https://git.ucsf.edu/academic-research-systems/azure-openai-demo

It contains `Eunomia_DB_demo.ipynb` and `eunomia.sqlite`.
The notebook was out-of-date and didn't work.

I've created an example `dbenv`, but I use my own hidden and not included `.dbenv`.

I updated the notebook and it is now functioning for me.

Nothing in the database or notebook is private so I've included them here.
Credit to the original author, whoever that might be.

Costs about a nickle to run.

Some of these answers are just wrong.

The most obvious change is model from 'text-davinci-003' to 'gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct'
